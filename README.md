# Covid_Assigment_Yuri_Cunha

This project is done for the DA2 class and it shows the possible association between number of cases and covid deaths.

On the following project, I checked the possible association between the number of confirmed Covid cases and their number of deaths associated with the disease by country on a given day. Using the Weighted - OLS model, considering the population size as the weight, I was able to reach a well-fitted model for the following dataset. The models states that the increase of the number of confirmed cases increases on average the number of deaths associated with the disease, and that the population numbers play an important role on that. It's important to mention that the data acquired may have some integrity and reliability issues due some government data collection standards.

ItÂ´s impoortant to mention that due some error while reading the instructions, I ended up doing another analysis using another date data.
